Zombie Academic Research

According to a 2009 Carleton University and University of Ottawa epidemiological analysis, an outbreak of even Living Dead's slow zombies "is likely
to lead to the collapse of civilization, unless it is dealt with quickly." Based on their mathematical modelling, the authors concluded that
offensive strategies were much more reliable than quarantine strategies, due to various risks that can compromise a quarantine. They also found that
discovering a cure would merely leave a few humans alive, since this would do little to slow the infection rate.
